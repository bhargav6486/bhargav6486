1. The code calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for example data.

2. It reads a dataset from a CSV file named "train.csv".
3. It checks for missing values in the dataset.
4. It plots boxplots for selected columns before handling missing values.
5. It converts the 'Date' column to datetime format.
6. It one-hot encodes the 'Date' column.
7. It prepares the data for linear regression by separating features and labels.
8. It splits the data into training and testing sets.
9. It trains a linear regression model using the training data.
10. It makes predictions using the test data.
11. It scales the features and trains the linear regression model on the scaled features.
12. It makes predictions on the scaled features.
13. It calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the predictions on scaled features.
